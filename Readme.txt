# Instructions to run the code

java Parser


I have attached .java as well as executable file. The file that is important is Parser.class. Just save it to some directory and run the command given above wherever you keep the .class file. I am using Java8 while coding.

Key Point about the code.

1. I am taking "Number" as case sensitive. So for detecting any number after "Number" it should be same as "Number".
